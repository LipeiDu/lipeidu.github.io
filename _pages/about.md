**This personal website was published online on August 26, 2018. To be updated.**

I'm a member of two collaborations, [BEST Collaboration](https://www.bnl.gov/physics/best/) and [JETSCAPE Collaboration](http://jetscape.wayne.edu/), working on the physics of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. My research is basically based on the frameworks of these two collaborations. 

Collaborations
======

Descriptions below are taken from the websites of the collaborations.

**BEST Collaboration**

The Beam Energy Scan Theory (BEST) Collaboration is a Topical Collaboration in Nuclear Theory, funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Nuclear Physics for the period 2016-2020.


**JETSCAPE Collaboration**

The Jet Energy-loss Tomography with a Statistically and Computationally Advanced Program Envelope (JETSCAPE) collaboration is an NSF funded multi-institutional effort to design the next generation of event generators to simulate the physics of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. It involves teams of theoretical and experimental physicists, computer scientists, and statisticians from nine institutions.


Research Interests
======
* Dynamical initialization of Hybrid Models of heavy-ion collisions
* Baryon transportation in heavy-ion collisions
* Hydrodynamic description of Quark-Gluon Plasma with fluctuations
* Jet-medium interaction

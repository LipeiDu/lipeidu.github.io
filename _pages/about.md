About me
======
I'm a member of two collaborations, BEST and JETSCAPE, working on the physics of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, so my research is in the framework of these two collaborations. 

Collaborations
======

BEST Collaboration
------
The Beam Energy Scan Theory (BEST) Collaboration is a Topical Collaboration in Nuclear Theory, funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Nuclear Physics for the period 2016-2020 (https://www.bnl.gov/physics/best/).


JETSCAPE Collaboration
------
The Jet Energy-loss Tomography with a Statistically and Computationally Advanced Program Envelope (JETSCAPE) collaboration is an NSF funded multi-institutional effort to design the next generation of event generators to simulate the physics of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. It involves teams of theoretical and experimental physicists, computer scientists, and statisticians from nine institutions. (http://jetscape.wayne.edu/)


Research Interests
======
1. Dynamical initialization of Hybrid Models of heavy-ion collisions
1. Baryon transportation in heavy-ion collisions
1. Hydrodynamic description of Quark-Gluon Plasma with fluctuations
1. Jet-medium interaction

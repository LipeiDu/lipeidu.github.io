## Photographing

**Photographing is fun!** I bought my first camera Canon EOS Rebel T5 in the summer of 2016. Please find some photos I took on [portfolio](https://lipeidu.github.io/portfolio/) page.


## Biking

Biking used to be one of my favorite hobbies. Below is a photo of my bike, a good buddy.

## Popular science writing

Making sciences more popular and accessible to people outside academia is very meaningful in my opinion. One of the helpful methods is to write more popular science articles, the number of which in Chinese is still quite limited. During the last few years when I was more available, I wrote some articles in Chinese for [Scientific American Magazine (Chinese Edition)](https://huanqiukexue.com/) and its (also a few other) social media websites, to introduce some latest research progresses in physics. I also was invited to translate some popular science articles in English into Chinese sometimes. It was quite enjoyable and also helpful for myself to get a broader view of physics.

### Original articles
I tried to introduce some latest progresses in physics and some interesting topics (mainly in 2017), and 6 of them appeared on Chinese Edition of Scientific American Magazine.
* About the structure of the proton and Electron-Ion Collider (July and August, 2017), mainly introducing work reported in _Phys. Rev. Lett. 117 (2016) 052301,_ _Phys. Lett. B 772 (2017) 832-838,_ and _Phys. Rev. D 94 034042 (2016),_ by Heikki Mantysaari and Bjoern Schenke.
* About the experimental search for Chiral Magnetic Effect (September, 2017), about work _Observation of Charge-Dependent Azimuthal Correlations in p-Pb Collisions and Its Implication for the Search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect, V. Khachatryan et al. (CMS Collaboration), Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 122301 (2017)._
* About the observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) (October, 2017), on _Observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, Akimov et. al. Science, Aug. 3, 2017._
* About the gravitational wave and nuclear Equation of State, on _Phys. Rev. D 86, 063001 (2012)_ and some other papers.
* About the observation of strong vorticity in heavy-ion collisions by STAR collaboration (October, 2017), on _Global Λ hyperon polarization in nuclear collisions, The STAR Collaboration, Nature 548, 62–65 (03 August 2017)._
* About proton decay (November, 2017).
* About Ads/CFT and quark-gluon plasma.
* About topological origin of equatorial waves (December, 2017), on _Topological origin of equatorial waves, Pierre Delplace et. al., Science  24 Nov 2017._
* About magnetic monopoles (January, 2018), on _Magnetic Monopole Mass Bounds from Heavy-Ion Collisions and Neutron Stars, Oliver Gould and Arttu Rajantie, Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 241601 (2017)._
* About determinism in General Relativity (February, 2018), on _Quasinormal Modes and Strong Cosmic Censorship, Vitor Cardoso et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 031103 (2018)._

### Translation
I was invited to translate some articles on Scientific American into Chinese for its Chinese Edition.

<p><b>Photographing is fun!</b> I bought my first camera Canon EOS Rebel T5 in the summer of 2016. On this page, some photos taken by me are displayed. They were mainly taken at places where I attended meetings and schools, or near The Ohio State University. See some details attached to each photo.</p>

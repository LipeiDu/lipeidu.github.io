title: "Dynamical Initialization and Baryon Evolution"
excerpt: "At Beam Energy Scan energies, the overlap time of colliding nuclei becomes long 
and instantaneous initialization of the hydrodynamics in the hybrid models becomes questionable. 
Besides, the baryon density could be large and its evolution becomes essential.<br/>"

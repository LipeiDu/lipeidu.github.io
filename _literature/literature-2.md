title: "Hydrodynamics with fluctuactions near the critical point"
excerpt: "Hydrodynamical calculations of the evolution of the Quark-Gluon Plasma have been 
extremely successful in describing the observables of soft particles. The hydrodynamical evolution 
near the QCD critical point is very important for searching the point.<br/>"
